A project I've been working on to (eventually) predict the prices of cards in Magic the Gathering. 

Currently still in the data exploration and preprocessing phase. 

Currently scrapes Scryfall data and uses that; 
I've also just started trying to scraping tournament results decklists and scraping that.
